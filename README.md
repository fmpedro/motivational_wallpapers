# Motivational Wallpapers
A simple python script that generates a wallpaper with a random motivational quote.

The quotes to be displayed can be customized through the `quotes.json` file.

At the moment there are not yet easy additional customization options, but changes can be done directly on the script.

You can define the generated output wallpaper as the defined wallpaper and then configure the script to be run at every login, restart or other trigger, as required.
